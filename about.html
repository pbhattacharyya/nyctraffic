                          <p class="body-text">We worked with three datasets for this project:</p>
                          <ol>
                          <br><li class="body-text">Daily traffic accidents data for the City of New York, taken from <a target="_blank" href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95">data.cityofnewyork.us</a>. This dataset contains information about the number of accidents by day, time, location, cause, number of deaths, number of injuries, and a number of other features.</li>
                          <br><li class="body-text">Daily weather data from <a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/bigquery-public-data:noaa_gsod.gsod2017?pli=1" target="_blank">NOAA</a>. This dataset includes information about the mean temperatures, highs and lows, precipitation, wind, fog, and a number of other features.</li>
                          <br><li class="body-text">Daily events calendar from <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/events/" target="_blank">nyc.gov</a>. We used data from this source to come up with a list of major events, such as national holidays and parades, for New York City.</li>

                          <p class="body-text">We looked at data for the year 2017 and investigated the following topics:</p>

                          <ol>
                            <br><li class="body-text">How do the number of accidents, injuries, and deaths vary based on time of day?</li>
                            <br><li class="body-text">How do the number of accidents vary based on the day of the week?</li>
                            <br><li class="body-text">How do the number of accidents per day vary based on weather?</li>
                            <br><li class="body-text">Can we use weather data to predict that how accident-prone a day might be?</li>

                          <h2>Where did this data come from and who has access to it?</h2>
                          <p class="body-text">We worked with three datasets for this project:</p>
                          <ol>
                          <br><li class="body-text">Part of the data for this project came from the NYC Open Data project. The traffic data comes from the NYPD’s databases, and it is manually run every month and reviewed by the TrafficStat Unit before being posted on the NYPD website. It is available to the public, and can be viewed by anybody.</li>
                          <br><li class="body-text">We also obtained data from <a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/bigquery-public-data:noaa_gsod.gsod2017?pli=1" target="_blank">NOAA</a>.</li>
                          <br><li class="body-text">We have also taken data from the NYC government’s events calendar. This data is also publicly available, and can be viewed by anybody.</li>
                          </ol>
          
                      </div>
                        
                      <div class="page-header">
                          <h2>Is the data accountable?</h2>
                          <p class="body-text">The traffic datasets come directly from NYPD’s archives as well as from other sources in the NYPD government. It is available to the public for viewing. We believe the data is fairly accountable, as it is used by researchers, policy makers, city governments and many more entities. The dataset are appropriately anonymized and publicly available.
                            </p>
                            <p class="body-text">Having said that, we do not have access to the tools that were used to collect the data, so they cannot be reproduced and validated. This is especially true for traffic data, which is reported by individual police officers and then collated in some way to be entered into the database.
                          </p> 
                      </div>
                        
                        <div class="page-header">
                          <h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
                          <p class="body-text">The traffic dataset is a complete snapshot of the accidents that take place on each day. The data is broken down by location and injury, and its collection is mandated by because the NYC Council passed Local Law #11 in 2011. 
                          </p>
                          <p class="body-text">The weather dataset is a complete and thorough snapshot of the weather in the New York City. It is based on data collected at the weather station in Central Park.
                            </p>
                            <p class="body-text">The events dataset is not a complete snapshot of all the events that happened in New York City in 2017. Instead, the events have been selected based on a number of previously determined criteria, such as size, significance and popularity. We chose events based on their likelihood to affect traffic (such as parades), and chose to leave out events that didn’t seem closely related to traffic (such as a christmas tree lighting). 
                              </p>
                          </div>
                        
                        <div class="page-header">
                          <h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
                          <p class="body-text">During initial exploratory exercises each dataset seemed coherent and validated our initial hypotheses as a team. This assumption was backed up as we continued to dig into the data. The lone exception is that five rows in the traffic spreadsheet had spurious location data.
                            </p>
                          </div>

                          <h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
                          <p class="body-text">The traffic data contains the official version of events for each accident in New York City as filed away by the NYPD. It is possible that in some cases, the data about the reason for the accident
                              Is wrong. This might be so for a few different reasons: perhaps the incident was reported incorrectly to the authorities or there is a court case pending and the true reason for the accident has not yet come to light.
                              </p>
                              <p class="body-text">
                                  The weather data is biased in favor of the weather station where that data was recorded. Since New York City is a fairly large area, it is possible that different regions experienced different weather patterns on a given day. This may be especially true for patchy showers and thunderstorms.
                              </p>
